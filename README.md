Study Aims
==========
To build on previous research, the current study aims to apply a whole genome sequencing approach to two unrelated twin families with a history of recurrent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures. The aim was to identify novel or previously implicated biological genomic signatures, which can be explored to further characterise ACL rupture susceptibility. 
The main objectives of the study are to (i) identify predicted pathogenic or potential modifiable variants for ACL rupture susceptibility, and (ii) identify genetic sequences or genetic intervals common between affected members within families or affected members between families. This study fills an important gap and adds to the growing knowledge of the natural history, and clinical heterogeneity of ACL rupture, with the potential for informing the design of new therapeutics.
